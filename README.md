# Space Age

## Description
Given an age in seconds or birthday, calculate how old someone would be on:

- Mercury: orbital period 0.2408467 Earth years

- Venus: orbital period 0.61519726 Earth years

- Earth: orbital period 1.0 Earth years, 365.25 Earth days, or 31,557,600 seconds

- Mars: orbital period 1.8808158 Earth years

- Jupiter: orbital period 11.862615 Earth years

- Saturn: orbital period 29.447498 Earth years

- Uranus: orbital period 84.016846 Earth years

- Neptune: orbital period 164.79132 Earth years

So if you were told someone were 1,000,000,000 seconds old, you should be able to say that they're 31.69 Earth-years old.


## Learning Outcomes

At the end of the this coding challenge, students will be able to;

- Analyze a problem, identify and apply programming knowledge for appropriate solution.
- Demonstrate their knowledge of algorithmic design principles by using JavaScript effectively.

## Problem Statement

-  Write a function that takes second and convert to any planet second.


## Happy coding!  ðŸ’ª
